# awesome-fedi

a repository that was created on relatively neutral ground in the fedisphere
for the purpose of ensuring everyone has access to tiny little utility scripts
that make people's lives easier. It's of educational value, or something.

I haven't decided if I will add an upstream on github yet. It would make things
easy for everyone, but it's also github.

* [cowsay-fedi](https://git.mentality.rip/sevvie/awesome-fedi/src/branch/master/cli/cowsay-fedi.sh) &mdash; a slightly more-verbose one-liner that retrieves a post by its object URL, formats it, and pipes it into [cowsay](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay) and [lolcat](https://github.com/tehmaze/lolcat/). Why? Um.
